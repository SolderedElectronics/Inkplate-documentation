What is Open Source?
--------------------

The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs.
Today, however, open source designates a broader set of values—what we call the open source way.
Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.

What is Open Source software?
-----------------------------

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
Source code is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see.
It's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software, program or application works.
Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

What is Open Source hardware?
-----------------------------

Open hardware or open source hardware, refers to the design specifications of a physical object which are licensed in such a way that said object can be studied, modified, created, and distributed by anyone.
Open hardware is a set of design principles and legal practices, not a specific type of object.
The term can therefore refer to any number of objects like automobiles, chairs, computers or robots.
Like open source software, the source code for open hardware schematics, blueprints, logic designs, Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings or files, etc. is available for modification or enhancement by anyone under permissive licenses.
Users with access to the tools that can read and manipulate these source files can update and improve the code that underlies the physical device.
They can add features, fix bugs or even modify the physical design of the object itself and, if they wish, proceed to share such modifications.
