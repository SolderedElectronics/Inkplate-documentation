Inkplate Peripheral Mode
========================
    Peripheral mode for Inkplate by Soldered
    Peripheral mode is uploaded to each Inkplate. It enables you to use the board
    without reprogramming. You just need to send commands via UART and it will
    show contents on its screen. 
    You can send commands via USB port or by directly connecting to ESP32 TX and RX pins.
    
    Don't forget you need to send #L(1)* after each command to show it on the display (equal to display.display()). 
    Peripheral mode Arduino code for all inkplates can be found under examples/other if needed to be installed again.
     
    Settings are:
    115200 baud, standard parity, ending with \\n\\r
