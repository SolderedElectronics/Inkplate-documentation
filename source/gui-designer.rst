Inkplate GUI designer 
=====================

Introduction
############
    GUI designer is intended to be a used as a tool for rapid design of user interfaces for 
    Inkplate devices. It offers standard library primitives, but has support for more advaced usage examples, by allowing advaced users to create JS and C code to be run in editor and on Inkplate device (see Widgets).
    You can check it out `here <https://solderedelectronics.github.io/Inkplate-GUI-Designer/>`_ and in our `git repository <https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-GUI-Designer>`_

Nomenclature
############

Component
---------
    | Primitive or widget, object representation that can be drawn to screen on Inkplate or in web editor.

Entity
------
    | Component but in code, or when rendering.
 
Primitives and widgets
----------------------
    | A design component can be a primitive or a widget.
    | Primitives are simple drop in replacements of Arduino API elements.
    | Widgets on the other hand are more complex, and can't have their attributes changed using simple editables.
    | Located on the left of the main screen.

Editables
---------
    | Sliders, input boxes, buttons etc. on the right of the screen.

Modifiers
---------
    | Draggable elements on screen, also mutable by editables if specified.
    | Also, by clicking on those after a red dot appears changes settings tab to current component.

Exporting code
##############
    | After you're done with editing, simlpy click on "Export C Code" in the upper left corner.
    | A download prompt will show and upon accepting it a header file will be downloaded.
    | Simply put the file in the same folder as your sketch, include it by putting:

    .. code-block:: C

        #include "generatedUI.h"

    | With all your other includes.

In code rendering
#################
    | Be sure to call mainDraw(); in your code when you want it to draw prespecified content.
    | You must clear the buffer before hand by calling display.clearDisplay();
    | and call display.display(); after mainDraw(); to put data on screen.

    .. code-block:: C

        mainDraw();
        display.display(); // Needs to be called to put buffer data on screen.

Custom data rendering
#####################
    | Of course you can leave the default values to be drawn on screen, but where's the fun in that.
    | To change primitive or widget data, simply acces a global variable in C.
    | You can find it's name in editor, on the top left, 
    | where it says Editing [ name ] and adding _[ whatever property you want to change]
    | Example:

    .. code-block:: C

        line0_start_x = 0;

    | Find all changeable properties under primitives and widgets documentation.
    | Note that you can't change bitmap width or height afterwards, indicated by their const declaration in generated header.

Editing widgets
###############
    | To be sure that widgets are as customizable as possible, they directly allow you to eddit their variables.
    | You can edit their JSON file by changing data under default or writing newer data into value slot, first one is always supported,
    | while second one is not guarantied.
    | To enter values click somewhere on screen to change focus.

Making widgets
##############
    | We strongly encourage those familiar with JavaScript to try their luck making widgets.
    | Take a look in our source, under widgets/clock.js or graph.js.
    | Basicaly all there needs to be is name, type (widget), id initialized to 0, 
    | variables shown to user, draw function (here used as a helper to _draw method),
    | getCCodeVariables (to be put globally) and getCCodeDraw (to be put into mainDraw);
    |
    | You can also specify getIncludes to include fonts or other.
    | Be sure to also push your widget object to widgets array to be deep cloned later into entites array.
    |
    | As for modifiers, make sure that in your variables you put set and distSqr (distance squared) functions into a specific variable.
    |
    | z value is default 0 to be rendered same priority as all, but can be changed, might even as a editable.

Using fonts
###########
    | Our editor does not include fonts, that needs to be done locally.
    | Easiest way is to use fonts already included in library, see `tutorial <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/using-fonts>`_ draw
    | for list.
    | 
    | User specifies font size in pixels, for rendering in editor, using default Arial font, while
    | Inkplate commonly uses pt for pixel size, so be aware to convert those.
    | One px is 0.75 pt, or a pt is 1.33 px
    |
    | More fonts can be added in /Fonts folder in Inkplate library, or by creating a /Fonts folder in sketch folder and adding them there.
    | As of writing, default supported fonts are:
    
    .. code-block:: C
