======================================

| Inkplate is a powerful, energy-efficient, Wi-Fi enabled ESP32 series of boards with an e-paper display. It's open hardware supported by an open-source software library, and it's easy to program, regardless of whether you prefer MicroPython or the Arduino IDE. It comes in different versions of screen sizes.
